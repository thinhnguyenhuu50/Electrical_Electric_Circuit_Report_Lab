\section{BJT's logic gate application}
Figure \ref{lab3_notGate_de} describes a straightforward NOT gate theoretical implementation using an NPN bipolar junction transistor. In the circuit, the NPN junction transistor operates in the saturation mode.

V1 = 0  When the source is off, the voltage would be 0V.\\
V2 = 5  When the source is on, the voltage would be 5V.\\
TD = 0  Delay time. This exercise assumes that there is no delay.\\
TR = 5ns  The rise time of the pulse (from off to on stage).\\
TF = 3ns  The fall time of the pulse (from on to off stage).\\
PW = 50ms  Pulse width: The time in which the source keeps on.\\
PER = 100ms  The period of the signal.\\
